Outline: How to test

All in C. No C++
Compile tsc with O3;
Compile the rest with O0; 

Ramp up;    testing;
[100 times] [10000 times]

Record all the points.
data should be stored as CSV
use excel to calc and generate the average and etc

Test_bench:
    while(testing):
	pid = fork()
	if (pid):
	    join()
	else:
	    run the testing
	    exit(0)
	

1. Measure overtime:
    Overtime of tsc_overhead
2. Call function:
    1. record time
    2. call function
    3. record time
3. System Call:
    1. No idea
4. Task create
    kthread
    fork:
	1.content copy (delete the overhead of operator++)
	    record()
	    fork()
	    if (pid):
		i++
		record()
	    else:
		pass
	2.no content copy
	    record()
	    fork()
	    if (pid):
		record()
5. context switch time:
    rebuild the kernel? too expensive
